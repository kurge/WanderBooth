# WanderBooth

WanderBooth is an offline-first photo booth application being developed for our own photo business. The desktop Host will target Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia 15.7.5 or later, while an iPad provides the customer-facing touchscreen. Operators can select among supported dedicated cameras, USB webcams, the computer's built-in camera, or the iPad camera. WanderBooth will sell both branded digital photos and physical prints, accept attendant-confirmed cash payments, and let customers retrieve their completed photos and looping slideshow from a private 30-day cloud link by scanning a QR code.

> [!warning] Public-repository safety
> The WanderBooth repository is public. Never commit customer photos, session databases, payment data, passwords, API keys, local backups, diagnostic exports, or private business records. The project folder is a separate nested Git repository so it does not use the unrelated repository currently rooted at `/Users/kurgegarcia`.
